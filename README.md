# gudlift-registration

1. Why


    This is a proof of concept (POC) project to show a light-weight version of our competition booking platform. The aim is the keep things as light as possible, and use feedback from the users to iterate.

2. Getting Started

    This project uses the following technologies:

    * Python v3.x+

    * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

        Whereas Django does a lot of things for us out of the box, Flask allows us to add only what we need. 
     

    * [Virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html)

        This ensures you'll be able to install the correct packages without interfering with Python on your machine.

        Before you begin, please ensure you have this installed globally. 


3. Installation

    1. Clone this repository using `$ git clone https://github.com/ClemRoy/Gudlft.git` (you can also download the code using [as a zip file])
    2. Move to the GUDLFT root folder
    3. Create a virtual environment for the project with `$ py -m venv env` on windows or `$ python3 -m venv env` on macos or linux.
    4. Activate the virtual environment with `$ env\Scripts\activate` on windows or `$ source env/bin/activate` on macos or linux.
    5. Install project dependencies with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Current Setup

    The app is powered by [JSON files](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_quick_guide.htm). This is to get around having a DB until we actually need one. The main ones are:
     
    * competitions.json - list of competitions
    * clubs.json - list of clubs with relevant information. You can look here to see what email addresses the app will accept for login.

5. Testing

    You are free to use whatever testing framework you like-the main thing is that you can show what tests you are using.

    We also like to show how well we're testing, so there's a module called 
    [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/) you should add to your project.
